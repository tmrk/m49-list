# M49 List of Countries in JSON

A browser app written in vanilla JavaScript that scrapes the United Nations Statistics Division's [Standard country or area codes for statistical use (M49)](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/) page.

It outputs a JSON object, containing an array of all countries with ISO 3166-1 alpha-2, alpha-3 and M49 numeric country codes, as well the numeric codes for sub-regions, regions and intermediate regions - as specified by the UN.
